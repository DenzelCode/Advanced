INSTALL file for PHP Shell

Downloading PHP Shell
=====================

You can always get the latest version of PHP Shell from:

  http://phpshell.sourceforge.net/



Installation
============

Installation is easy: first unpack the tarball or zipfile downloaded
from the above website into your webserver.  This will create a
subdirectory called phpshell-@VERSION@ for PHP Shell version @VERSION@.

Try loading the file ``phpshell.php`` in your browser and check that
you are served a page that asks you to authenticate yourself with a
username and a password.  If you do not see such a page, then please
check that you have entered the URL correctly and that PHP is working
on your server.



Configuration
=============

All configuration happens in the ``config.php`` file.  This is an
ini-file despite its name.  Ini-files consist of a number of sections,
each containing a number of 'key = "value"' pairs.  PHP Shell has tree
sections: '[users]' for configuring usernames and passwords,
'[aliases]' for configuring shell aliases, and '[settings]' for
general settings.


Setting usernames and passwords
-------------------------------

As a security precaution PHP Shell has no default username and
password (people often forget to change them...).  PHP Shell stores 
its passwords in a hashed form, so that it is impossible to see what 
a user's password is by just viewing the configuration file. To add 
users to your configuration, first go to the supplied ``pwhash.php`` 
script. On that page, enter a username and password and press 
'update'. The page will display a line you should add to your 
config.php file. 

For example, with username 'alice' and password 'secret', you might 
add the following line: 

  [users]
  alice = "$2y$10$lk2VP./qlxUjkVstLTIuq.htIcR9RRSEI635sa2m5Zl8p90C5t7mS"

You will not get exactly the same line if you try it out, this is a
feature of the system which means that both "alice" and "bob" could
have "secret" as their password, and you would not be able to tell
from just looking at ``config.php``.

Please see the instructions given in ``pwhash.php`` for additional 
information. 

PHP Shell also used to support storing passwords in the clear, but 
that option is no longer supported.


Shell Aliases
-------------

As in a normal shell, PHP Shell supports alias expansion, albeit in a
simple form.  Aliases are defined by 'key = "value"' pairs in the
'[aliases]' section.  The "key" will be matched against the first
token of the command line and substituted with the "value" given.

Two convenient aliases are already defined:

  [aliases]
  ls = "ls -CvhF"
  ll = "ls -lvhF"


General Settings
----------------

You can define some other settings in the '[settings]' section:


home-directory = "Path/to/some/directory": 
what directory should be considered as home-directory, where should the
user be after startup and where will he return after a bare "cd" command.

safe-mode-warning = true (or false):
should PHP Shell print a warning, if PHP safe mode is detected? PHP Shell will 
probably not work correctly if safe mode is enabled.

PS1 = "string"  (e.g.: "$ "):
What string should be used as standard prompt string.

file-upload = false (or true):
do you want to use the new file-upload feature?


Bugs?  Comments?
================

If you find a bug or miss something in PHP Shell, please take a look
at the Tracker System at SourceForge:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/phpshell/_list/tickets

There you will find trackers for Bugs, Patches, and Feature Requests.
You are invited to add items to these so that they won't get lost.

You can also email the development list, found at:

  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phpshell-devel

This list is for discussion about all things PHP Shell and it is a
good place to discuss a feature or bug before adding it to one of the
SourceForge trackers.
