Phpshell 2.5
------------
  * Fixes for PHP 7
  * no longer support plain text passwords in config file
  * use standard PHP password_hash/password_verify functions
    (instead of a self written solution)
  * HTML and Javascript fixes.


2012-07-11  Jan Kanis
  * implemented login rate limiting. Also an important security feature. 
  * updated INSTALL, to point people to pwhash.php as a first choice and note cleartext passwords are deprecated
  * add missing dependency info to README
  * show a big warning if trying to log in over nonsecured connection. 

2012-07-09  Jan Kanis
  * Harden session management: 
    - use secure randomness to initialise the session id, if available from /dev/urandom
    - set session to httponly if possible
    - set session to https if possible
    - lock the session cookie to PHP Shell's URL
    - lock session to user's IP address
    - enable an absolute timeout for the validity of the login information
    - re-generate a new session id after authentication, to prevent session fixation attacks
    - also generate a new session id after logout
  * rename 'nounce' to 'nonce', and use secure randomness for initialization. 
  * update the SECURITY file regarding the above changes. 
  * add an additional note regarding Safe Mode to the SECURITY file. 

2012-07-01  Jan Kanis
  * added support for phpass. This is (I believe) an important security improvement as it includes password stretching. 
  * Accept 'clear' command only if authenticated & CSRF token checked

2012-06-29  Jan Kanis
  * PHP Shell now implements protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (CSRF). A security critical app like this should have implemented that a long time ago. 
  * change terminal output from a <textarea> to a <pre>, so the output doesn't get sent back to the server every POST.
  * Make sure editors 'Exit without Saving' also works if javascript is disabled. 
  * Add 'logout' button to the error page so you can reset your session

2012-06-28  Jan Kanis
  * if 'execute command' is clicked while a file to upload is selected, the file is no longer uploaded. Upload and terminal are now separate forms. 
  * add clear also as a builtin.
  * Don't crash if the current directory has unreadable entries
  * fix some small bugs in the editor
  * replace htmlentities with htmlescape everywhere

2012-06-28  Jan Kanis
  * Merged changes from my private branch and trunk. Some features were already in both branches.

2010-09-22  Jan Kanis <jan.code@jankanis.nl>
  In my private branch: 
  * Refactored the code to handle builtins to make it more generic
  * Added a 'download' builtin
  * Changed the directory handling. 'cd' is now no longer a buitin but is handled by the shell itself. When the shell is done it sends its working directory back to php over a special file descriptor. 
  * Changed all calls to file handling functions with shell calls to work with the new directory handling and to be no longer hindered by php's open_basedir setting. 
  * Correctly encode \0 characters in shell output.
  * Removed charset parameter from htmlspecialchars, to handle cases where the output isn't valid UTF-8. 
  * AUTHORS: Added myself
  * pwhash.php: Set sha1 as default hash.
  * .htaccess: New file.

Phpshell 2.4
  * Commands with HTML entities (e.g.: echo "&uuml;") were displayed 
    encoded in the history-output
  * Updated list of not allowed usernames (restriction of parse_ini_file())
  * phpshell stopped working, when the current directory was removed
    or made unreadable (by the user or another process).
  * Fixed correct encoding of prompt string.
  * Safe mode warning was not displayed.


Phpshell 2.3
  * added file upload feature (not enabled by default)
  * fixed a strange UTF-8 bug
  * added internal history command
  * prompt $PS1 is now configurable
  * Commands with HTML entities (e.g.: echo "&uuml;") were displayed 
    encoded in the output

2010-11-21  Wolfgang Dautermann
    * One can navigate to higher level directories using hyperlinks.

2010-11-05  Wolfgang Dautermann
    * Use SHA1 password hashing if possible. Changed project links to http://phpshell.sourceforge.net/
2010-01-30  Natan Bueno <natan.bueno@gmail.com>

	Added AddOn to editor "vim".

	Replaced deprecated function ereg by the function preg_match

2005-12-27  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php:
	Added code to prevent simple replay attacks by only accepting each
	login form once.
	
2005-12-25  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* INSTALL: Information about the new internal configuration.
	
	* phpshell.php: Made authentication internal.

	* SECURITY: New file.

	* config.php: New file.

	* style.css: New file.  Renamed from phpshell.css.

2004-03-27  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.29: Removed debug output.

	* README 1.11: Updated documentation for new cool shell-like interface.

	* INSTALL 1.5:
	Updated documentation about the command substitution using alises.

	* phpshell.css 1.2:
	New styles to make the textarea and input box blend together.

	* phpshell.php 1.28: A little documentation for the alias feature.

	* phpshell.php 1.27:
	The shell now looks and behaves much more like a real shell: the shell
	now has a commandline history just like a real shell.

	The parsing of 'cd' commands have been rewritten so that even more
	special cases are taken care of, and simple command substitution using
	aliases have been introduced.

2004-03-24  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.26:
	Increased year of copyright to 2004.  Fixed the references to the PNG
	images, as pointed out by Michael Z. Bell.

2003-11-11  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* AUTHORS 1.6:
	Added Wolfgang Dautermann <dauti@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* phpshell.php 1.25:
	Ups, I committed with $passwd = array('foo' => 'bar').

	* phpshell.php 1.24:
	Wolfgang Dautermann <dauti@users.sourceforge.net> suggested
	that the directory list should be sorted.

	Also, changing directory through symbolic links now works as expected,
	so that it's possible to go back using 'cd ..'.

2003-04-01  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* INSTALL 1.4:
	New instructions on how to change the username and password.

	Updated to be in sync with new instructions on how the password
	protection works.

	* phpshell.css 1.1: New file.

	* phpshell.php 1.23:
	Updated to use XHTML 1.0 Strict and the $_* variables in PHP
	4.1.0. This effectively breaks compatibility with earlier versions of
	PHP. If you cannot upgrade your PHP installation (you really should
	consider upgrading to get hold of the latest security and bug fixes)
	when just use PhpShell version 1.7 --- there's no new functionality in
	this release.

	* COPYING 1.1: New file.

	* phpshell.php 1.22: Changed PHP Shell into PhpShell.

	* phpshell.php 1.21: Added HTTP basic authentication to the script.

	* phpshell.php 1.18:
	Use the directory of phpshell.php as the default working directory.

	* AUTHORS 1.3: Added Gerry Calderhead <caldergf@everythingsucks.co.uk>.

	* phpshell.php 1.17:

2002-06-10  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* INSTALL 1.3: Added a section about Safe Mode in PHP.

	* AUTHORS 1.2: Added a notice about Robert Niess <sturm@i-st.net>.

	* phpshell.php 1.16:

	* phpshell.php 1.15: Small changes in the layout.

	* phpshell.php 1.14:
	Updated copyright statements - they were getting quite old :-)

	Added a tip from Jeremy Miller <JMiller@marketaxess.com> about how to
	use PHP Shell together with Sudo to execute code as another user.

2001-12-10  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.13:
	I found out that 'ls -F' produced better output than 'ls -p'.

	* README 1.6: Told people about the rewriting of 'ls' into 'ls -F'

	* phpshell.php 1.12:
	You can now travel through the filesystem by using the normal 'cd'
	command. If your command involves 'cd', it will be intercepted and the
	current working directory will be changed accordingly.

	* README 1.5: Updated the documentation a bit.

2001-02-11  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.11:
	Another suggestion from Thomas Langen <langen@langensoft.de>: some
	people can't use the .php extension, so now the script uses $PHP_SELF
	instead.

	* phpshell.php 1.10:
	Expanded all PHP start-tags (<?) to <?php, as suggested by Thomas
	Langen <langen@langensoft.de>.

	* phpshell.php 1.6:
	Added a link to gimpster.com at the bottom of the page

2000-08-05  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>

	* phpshell.php 1.5:
	Removed references to php3 - I now use php4 so all my files end with
	just a '.php'

2000-06-21  Martin Geisler  <mgeisler@mgeisler.net>
